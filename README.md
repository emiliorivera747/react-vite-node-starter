## Vite and Node.js Starter template 
If you're looking to get started with Vite and Node.js, you've come to the right place! Feel free to clone the repository and start building your new project.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (install globally with `npm install -g pnpm`)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Waterlily-Intake-Form.git
   cd Waterlily-Intake-Form/
   ```

2. **Install project dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm i
   ```

3. **Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   pnpm i
   ```

4. **Return to the project root directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   ```

5. **Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm i
   ```

6. **Return to the project root directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   ```

7. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Project Structure

- `frontend/`: Contains the frontend code for the application.
- `backend/`: Contains the backend code for the application.
- `package.json`: Root-level configuration for scripts and dependencies.

## Running the Application

The `npm run dev` command starts both the frontend and backend development servers concurrently. Once running, you can access the application at `http://localhost:<port>` (check the console output for the exact port).
